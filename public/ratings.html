            <p>You are your own critic, which we appreciate. Here you'll find all the ratings you ever made.
                Additionally,if you've judged a lot of shows and movies, you can search for specific ones. Or more
                importantly, through here, you can make new ratings, or delete old ones!
                <br><br>
                Please remember that only you will be able to see your specific rating. Other users (and you) will only
                see average ratings when looking at movies. This choice has been made by us to protect users from witch
                hunting and any other forms of threats. Your review will have an influence on the average rating, and
                you can still show your friends your specific ratings once you access your account!
