!!!
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING WITH THIS RESTFUL SERVICE ON A NEW DEVICE, PLEASE READ!
!!!

Our RESTful service includes a setup.js file that is essential for the tests that we made in Mocha/Supertest.
Once you’ve set up the database and have it online, run the index.js and before doing anything else, open a
program like Postman.

Using Postman or any service like it, type the following POST request: http://localhost:3000/api/import/

It is essential to run this routing first before running the test.js or trying out any of the other operations of this
RESTful service.

The setup.js file will add some dummy data (movies, users and ratings) to your database. The tests rely on some of this
data to be present, otherwise the majority will run into fails. We cannot be blamed for this, as we have to check
something in our tests, and don’t know what you’ll add in the time, but we do know what data we intend to be present.
So please run the request mentioned before, failing to do so will make it seem like our tests don’t work.
